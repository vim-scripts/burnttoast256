This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4075

This is the color theme I made for myself as I prefer to work on a dark background, namely black, without text that is too bright while still keeping a good contrast.  I based it heavily on http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2140 and if you don't like my scheme you might like his.  Check it out.

It includes colors for the normal text, the cursor and cursor line and column, search, status line, selection, line numbers, etc., as well as colors for syntax highlighting, diff mode, and some others.

The color scheme should be exactly the same in gvim as it is in vim and it has been tested for readability in both.  Required version written as 7.3, as it has colors for the just added "CursorLineNr", but it probably will work on previous versions without any problems.
